# Getting Started with Penetration Testing

A comprehensive guide for beginners who want to start their journey in penetration testing and ethical hacking.

## What is Penetration Testing?

Penetration testing, or "pen testing," is a security assessment that simulates real-world attacks on systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.

## Essential Skills

### 1. Networking Fundamentals
Understanding TCP/IP, DNS, routing, and network protocols is crucial:

```bash
# Basic network commands
ipconfig / ifconfig
netstat -an
traceroute / tracert
```

### 2. Operating Systems
Familiarize yourself with:
- Linux (Kali Linux, Ubuntu)
- Windows
- macOS

### 3. Programming Languages
Learn at least one scripting language:
- Python
- Bash
- PowerShell

## Essential Tools

### Reconnaissance
- **Nmap**: Network scanning
- **Wireshark**: Packet analysis
- **Recon-ng**: Web reconnaissance

### Web Application Testing
- **Burp Suite**: Web application security testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Open-source web application scanner
- **SQLMap**: Automated SQL injection testing

### Exploitation
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework
- **Cobalt Strike**: Advanced threat simulation

## Methodology

### 1. Planning and Reconnaissance
- Define scope and objectives
- Gather information about the target
- Identify potential entry points

### 2. Scanning
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration
- Vulnerability scanning

### 3. Gaining Access
- Exploit vulnerabilities
- Escalate privileges
- Maintain persistence

### 4. Maintaining Access
- Establish backdoors
- Cover tracks
- Document findings

### 5. Analysis and Reporting
- Document all findings
- Provide remediation recommendations
- Present results to stakeholders

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Always obtain proper authorization before testing any system.

- Get written permission
- Define scope clearly
- Respect privacy and data protection laws
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Learning Resources

### Online Platforms
- HackTheBox
- TryHackMe
- VulnHub
- OverTheWire

### Certifications
- CompTIA Security+
- CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker)
- OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)
